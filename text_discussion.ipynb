    "Construct different multiple linear regression (MLR) models on the training data, consisting of 733 workers to examine the relationship between some of the independent variables, with years of experience and years of education as the base, and the monthly wage. Test the models' accuracy on the test data including of 183 workers.\n",

    "There are a total of 15 independent variables in the dataset, including experience and education. Identify missing variables that potentially cause omitted variable bias (OVB) and incorporate them into the base model. Evaluate the fit of the new model and check for multicollinearity\n",

    "Consider other potential methods of model formulations and independent variables that could improve the model's fit and predictive accuracy.\n",

    "**4. Data cleaning**\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider two approaches to data cleaning. The first one is to drop datas consist of null values only to the extent of dependent variables that we decide to use in the model formulation. This way, minimum number of data will be removed, which both helps remain as much data as possible, but still ensure consistency and integrity in the analysis. However, we find it challenging to figure out which dependent variables will be used in the formulation in the first stage. Therefore we come up with the second approach of dropping all datas that one or more of the dependent variables are null. This way, 203 datas of the train dataset and 56 datas of the test data set were removed. We acknowledge that reducing the size of the dataset significantly may impact its representativeness of the population, however as a trade-off, it would also prevent biases or inaccuracies in the regression results that the original one may have caused. Hence, the analysis ensures that model outputs are based fully on complete data, enhancing reliability of the insights into the relationships between these variables. For future research purposes, additional and complete data connection, together with research and analysis should be conducted to give timely and optimal findings of the study."
